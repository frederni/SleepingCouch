*A simple PHP-based booking system sending ical emails based on bookings*

This project is the mere result of exam procrastinations and an unfortunate wish to learn some basic PHP (to which, I regret).

The website consists of a simple form, where the responses are adapted to the appropriate format and finally sent as an e-mail with an attached ical-invitation.
